        <div class="sobre-conteudo">
            <p class="sobre-paragrafo">Hi! My name is Diogo Rua, and I'm currently studying engineering at ISCTE-IUL. 
                I always knew that computer engineering was the right course to me and I couldn't be more satisfied with my progress so far. <br><br><br>
                I started programming before attending university at home, starting with small projects that helped me entering in this complex world but in the same time rewarding which is the art of programming.
                Combining technical expertise with a tremendous willingness to learn something new, I expanded my range of knowledge to do something related to coding using Java, HTML, CSS, Python, C, MySql, PHP. <br><br><br>
                All this tools contributed to my personal development and increased my skills, whether as a student or as a person.
                I'm always looking to do something new related to my area. All of this with one purpose, a young man with a big desire to be successful in this branch of technology.
                I want to share my ideas with everyone that surrounds me and I want even more to learn with the people that surround me too. I think this is the right path for my success.</p>

                        A full java project developed with the goal to create a similar game like Donkey-Kong.
                        It's a classic arcade game where I (user) can control a character called Jump-Man inside a room with platforms and stairs. <br>
                        In that room there's Donkey Kong, a villain which movement is independent from Jump-Man's movement, throwing several atacks to our character.
                        Basically the main goal is to move Jump-Man along three levels (three diferent rooms) to rescue the princess.

                    <p class="paragrafo-projetos">Atari Go is a simplified version of the traditional board game Go.
                        This board game is played by one player using black stones and the opponent using white stones. 
                        The first player to capture a predefined number of the opponent's stones wins the game. <br>
                        Players take turns placing one stone on the board, and passing a turn is not allowed. Stones can only be placed on the intersections of the board lines that are not already occupied. 
                        Once placed, a stone cannot be moved. <br>
                        A capture occurs when a player's stones completely surround (not considering diagonals) one or more of the opponent's stones, meaning that the captured stone(s) have no remaining liberties.
                        It is invalid to play on intersections that have no liberties. A stone cannot be placed in such a way that the group it belongs to is left with no liberties, unless this move results in the capture of one or more of the opponent's stones.

                        This project aims to explore the application of artificial neural networks in controlling complex systems by
                        evolving a feed-forward neural network to play the Fruit Catcher game. <br>
                        The goal of the game is to catch the good fruits while avoiding the bombs (which are disguised as fruits).
                        The objective is to optimize the performance of the neural network using a genetic algorithm.
                        Additionally, you should train a decision tree classifier to identify which fruits are safe to catch.
